Provide a simple donate widget that will allow visitors to donate money
through the payment provider pay.nl, which supports iDeal debit-card
transactions.

== Description ==

Accept donations on your wordpress site using debit-card iDeal payments as used in 
the Netherlands. This plugin is not about a full-fledged webshop payment integration.

== Installation ==

First activate the plugin.

Next visit wp-admin/widgets.php and drag the 'Simple Donate Paynl' widget to the sidebar.

Before you can actually use this widget, you need an account at pay.nl. After you setup
things there, you need to activate the 'iDeal' payment method on the location you want
to use for your wordpress site. If that doesn't make much sense now, first read the docs
provided by pay.nl and follow their instructions.

Once you have configured the payment options at pay.nl, configure the widget and fill out
the configuration form.
